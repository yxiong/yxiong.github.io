Here are some useful shell alias for using tmux:

```shell
alias ta='tmux attach'
alias tn='tmux new -s'
```

When starting a new terminal console, it is a good idea to create a new tmux session with `tn shell` command, or to attach to an existing session with `ta`.

When already in a tmux session, the following shortcuts are useful:

```
C-b d   # ==> Detach, i.e. get out of tmux sessions
C-b s   # ==> Change to a different session
C-b [   # ==> Enter into search/copy/paste mode
    C-u      # ==> Page up
    C-?      # ==> Search
    ijkl...  # ==> Genearl vim moving operators
    <Space>  # ==> Enter selection mode
        <Enter>    # ==> Yank the selected text
            C-b ]      # ==> Paste the text above
```
