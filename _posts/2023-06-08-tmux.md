Here are some useful shell alias for using tmux:

```shell
alias ta='tmux attach'
alias tn='tmux new -s'
```

When starting a new terminal console, it is a good idea to create a new tmux session with `tn shell` command, or to attach to an existing session with `ta`.
The benefit for using tmux sessions are:

1. It is easier to move the sessions around (say from one terminal window to another)
1. It is easier to scroll up and down using keyboard, and search for content

When already in a tmux session, the following shortcuts are useful:

```
C-b d   # ==> Detach, i.e. get out of tmux sessions
C-b s   # ==> Change to a different session
C-b [   # ==> Enter into search/copy/paste mode
    C-u      # ==> Page up
    C-?      # ==> Search
    ijkl...  # ==> Genearl vim moving operators
    <Space>  # ==> Enter selection mode
        <Enter>    # ==> Yank the selected text
            C-b ]      # ==> Paste the text above
```
