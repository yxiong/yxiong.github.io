## General Problem Statement

(From Wikipedia)

> The multi-armed bandit problem is a problem in which a decision maker iteratively selects one of multiple fixed
> choices (i.e. arms or actions) when the properties of each choice are only partially known at the time of allocation,
> and may become better understood as time passes.
